    <h1>The Instagram Activist Manifesto</h1>
    <p class="intro">During a pandemic spreadable by physical contact, how can we be active members of social causes online? Through social media, we can spread important information and resources for the community in an easily accessible way. Information is the most valuable thing we have and it should be accurate and accessible to everyone. Everyone should have the opportunity to be active in their social cause.
    </p>

    <div class="beliefs">
        <p>As internet users, we become commodified as we participate in the spectacle that is social media. By seizing the means of production of Instagram posts, we create our own content and find power in our own work and community. 
        </p>
        <p>
        We recognize that not everyone has the ability to go out and organize physically. We recognize that not everyone is in the position to donate to causes or mutual aid funds. We encourage people to do whatever they feel they are able to do to participate safely.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ask yourself these simple questions when creating or consuming Instagram infographics. Become the right kind of superspreader (of information!).
