    <div class="questions">
        <p>Have I read the entire post? Have I checked who created or posted it? Are there reliable sources cited? Is the information up to date? When I share this post, who will see it? Do my followers already agree on these topics? Are they already aware of this information? Have I done more than just share this post? What steps am I taking to further be active in the movement? Why am I really interested in sharing this information? Am I benefitting the movement by sharing this?
