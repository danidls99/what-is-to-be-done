    <h1>@theCreator Questions to Ask Yourself</h1>
    
    <div class="questions">
        <p>What messages am I trying to convey? Where will I be getting my information? Have I cited sources? Who is my audience? Is it accessible to them? Is it accessible to a diverse audience? Have I been respectful? Does the design invite further investigation? Do my design choices have integrity? Is it actually legible? Does the aesthetic do the topic justice? Am I simplifying complex topics? Who is being affected? Do I have the right to share this information?
